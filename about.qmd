Hi, I'm Sydney Traugott!

This website is a product of my statistics class called, Data Management and Visualization. 

I'm currently a psychology major at Appalachian State University. Besides being a senior at AppState, I'm currently a research assistant and in the Honor's College. Currently I'm aiming to get a PsyD in Clinical Psychology.
